                        Make your voice heard. The Change.org app is exactly what its name suggests; a mobile version of the online petitioning website, 
                        Change.org. It’s purpose is to increase the reach of the causes that matter, and allow for petitions to be more widely accessible 
                        by the general public. Change does not just happen; it is fought for, and this app will help anyone and everyone make an impact wherever they are.

                    <h1>The Problem and Inspiration</h1>
                    <p>
                        In today’s fast-paced, technologically interconnected society, it has become increasingly difficult to feel like you can make an impact. 
                        As a drop in the ocean that is the worldwide web, many are led to believe that their opinions are washed away by the overpowering tides of 
                        the media, or whoever is popular. However, one online petition website is changing this. CHANGE.org, founded in 2007 by Ben Rettray has become
                         a powerful medium to advocate for causes that matter, and its 410 million users have been able to truly make a difference in the world. Over
                          65 000 victories have been achieved in 196 countries, and this number shall only continue to rise. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, with all that being said, these numbers can be far higher. With the recent Black Lives Matters Movement, there has been an influx in
                         visitors to Change.org. More and more people are logging onto the website to advocate for what they believe in, but in a time and age where 
                         everything has gone mobile, the lack of an app for the petitioning website seems odd and unintuitive. As I was scrolling through Instagram 
                         and clicking through social media stories, I imagined if only the links to these petitions could redirect me to an app, so that I could easily 
                         find more petitions and share them with my friends and followers. An app would make these petitions more widely accessible, more easily spread, 
                         and encourage the average Joe on their phone to sign onto more and more causes they want to get behind. I did a quick Google search and found 
                         that many are asking for a Change.org app, and as a result it was decided. Linking to a website is a thing of the past, and so I designed a mobile 
                         App that will revolutionize and revitalize the way we sign and share petitions. 
                    </p>
                    <h1>VISION</h1>
                    <p>
                        As my first time ever designing an application, I went through all of my personal favourite apps to draw inspiration. The app that truly caught my
                         eye was the insanely popular Instagram. Instagram seems to be THE social media app these days; and that is for good reason. Its elegant and simplistic
                          design allows for smooth navigation and a stream-lined user experience. There is just something about how the app flows that leads users (such as myself)
                           to get stuck into it for hours; scrolling down the feed or tapping through stories. Thus, I decided to incorporate these elements into the app. The main 
                           page with news and petitions features a scrolling feed, which allows the user to filter through relevant and interesting stories comfortably. I also added
                            the comments section, which adds a sense of community and freedom of expression. In addition to this, the menu dock at the bottom which allows  you to 
                            switch between functionalities is a feature found in many apps, and is something the user has become used to, which is why I included it. All in all, I 
                            hoped to create a user experience that would feel familiar and welcoming, and if my Change.org app concept could deliver a similar feel to that of the 
                            social media giant, it would draw more users to the app.

                    <h1>Process</h1>
                    <p>
                        When I first conceptualized the idea for the project, I started with pencil and paper. I remember grabbing my trusty notebook and drawing up a couple screens 
                        for the app; having no idea how to design or structure an app whatsoever. My designs were purely based on what I thought looked good in an app from my experiences
                         using a multitude of different apps on my phone. When I was content with the way it looked, I moved onto the digital canvas. Little did I know how much my design 
                         would change when it met Figma. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id = "bodyImg2">
                    <img src = "changeProcess.JPG" class = "change2">
                </div>
                <div id = "bodyText4">
                    <p>
                        Using Figma was surprisingly simple; considering it was my first time using anything of its kind. I had previous experience with the Adobe Creative Suite, and my 
                        time spent on Photoshop designing posters for clubs and projects proved somewhat valuable, but there was still a bit of a learning curve. However, after watching a 
                        couple of tutorials, I felt very comfortable with the software and began putting my plans into action. What I found immediately was that many of my designs did not 
                        look as nice when implemented online, and that there were alternate layouts that were way more attractive. I began to experiment with the tools, shapes and fonts and 
                        ended up with the final design. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some key things I want to highlight in the design: first the colour scheme. From the website it is clear that the main colours of Change.org consist of red, grey, 
                        and white, with red being the focal point of the brand. The use of red conveys a sense of urgency, passion and is often associated with strong emotions such as anger.
                         It is a powerful accent colour to any layout that jumps out at the viewer, and in the case of my design, is incorporated to stir up a call-to-action within the user.
                          For these reasons, I used the red to highlight the buttons to attract user action. The use of the grey and white are to balance out the red. Grey is a neutral colour,
                           and my use of dark and light grey rather than black are to make the layout easier on the eyes. It also gives off professionalism and sophistication. Finally, the
                            white is used in the background to contrast against the rest of the design to draw the user more to the content on the screen. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another aspect of the design is the choice of font and headings. For an app about petitions, I wanted to create a layout that made an impact, like that of an enlistment 
                        poster. That is why I included strong, bold messages here and there such as the “Make your voice heard” on the login screen or the “You can make a difference” on the 
                        screen you see when starting a petition. All of the headings are large, bold and clear to show that it is the focus of the page. The choice of Roboto in this design is 
                        for formality, and the sans serif helps to add a rounder feel to the design. It is also very similar to the font in the logo, which is found at the top left of every 
                        screen. 
                    </p>
                    <h1>Final Design</h1>
                    <p>The final prototype is below! Enjoy! :D </p>

                </div>
                <div id = "bodyText5">
                    <h1>Next Steps</h1>
                    <p>
                        In terms of the design, there is ALOT to improve upon. I find that many of my screens have far too much text or information, which takes away from the experience of 
                        using an app vs a website. Also many of the app processes are not as optimized as they could be. If I were to reimagine the app, I would also incorporate gestures such 
                        as swiping up to reveal more info, in order to alleviate the congestion on many of the screens and to create a more flow-y experience. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the process, I should have definitely gathered more background research. I should have conducted surveys to see how people feel on the topic, and based more of 
                        my design on that. Furthermore, I should have read more into app design and UI/UX design in general to incorporate more key elements into my project. There are definitely 
                        some subtleties  that I am unaware of that will elevate my design to another level. It is easy to look at something and say “ooh that looks good” or “that looks bad” but
                         incredibly difficult to understand the how and the why behind what is on the surface. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All in all, as a 1A Systems Design student enrolled in design courses, this (quarantine) project has been a pleasure to work on and I look forward to learning more on 
                        how I can improve as the term progresses! I can confidently say that graphic design is my passion, and although I have a long way to go, I am excited to see where this 
                        passion can take me.
