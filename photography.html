                        we still found a way to make the most of things, and thus I was lucky enough to spend the summer admiring sunrises, awe-ing at 
                        shooting stars, getting fishing rods completely tangled up, and just being around the people I cared about most. It was 
                        lit, and I look forward with excitement (and worry and confusion) to the next chapter of my life :DDD
