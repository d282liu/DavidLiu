                    <p> Hey guys! My name's David Liu, and I am a fun-loving, charismatic, and adventurous person going into my first year in Systems Design Engineering at 
                        the University of Waterloo. I have lived my entire life in Toronto, Ontario and attended A Y Jackson Secondary School for my secondary school education.
                        Before I go any further into my personal life, I would like to talk about my experiences and how they have made me who I am today. I am grateful to have been blessed with 
                        a plethora of opportunities throughout my life, through which I have met many remarkable people, and these experiences as well as the individuals involved 
                        have taught me countless important life skills and that I will carry with me for the rest of my existence. So here we go! First, being elected as Student Council 
                        President had taught me a great deal about working in a team and how to adapt under pressure. Strong leadership is critical in setting and achieving goals, and 
                        I was lucky enough to lead a council of 15 other student leaders, each of which inspired me to be the best President I could be. Teaching students English overseas
                        at four different schools (from elementary - highscool) in Taiwan taught me how to communicate, even with the presence of a cultural/language barrier. It also 
                        strengthened my faith and persistence, as even in the most frustrating, painful moments with my students, I learned that if I pressed on and kept finding new ways to teach, 
                        I would eventually get the point across. It was a good feeling, seeing my students grow, many of whom to this day still connect with me.(I Also learned of how good 
                        Taiwanese food is). Founding an Engineers Without Borders chapter at my school connected me with a vast network of professional engineers all over the country, 
                        and allowed me put my creativity into practicality to adress root causes of global poverty and inequality in areas of need. In the future, I would like to make a difference
                        just like those Engineers. My many other experiences such as DECA, athletics, SHAD, and music cultivated my hobbies, and helped me to connect with like-minded 
                        youth who shared those same interests. In DECA, I had almost given up hope in making provincials after not making it out of regionals for the third year in a row, but I kept
                        at it (the exact same event) and made it to ICDC (which was cancelled, but that's not the moral of the story). Staying up to build a business plan for a biodegradeable pipette 
                        company with five other people (who are basically my Newfoundland family now) at SHAD Memorial was incredibly stressful, but showed me that it is possible to get anything
                        done when you put your mind to it. SHAD also introduced me to some of the coolest people from across the country, and is an experience that will never leave me. However with 
                        all this being said, I am still unsure of what I want to do professionally.  Currently, I am very interested in product design as well as software development, 
                        and am still learning all about it whenever I can. But for now, all I know is that I have always loved finding creative solutions for problems all around us, and I 
                        hope that one day I can turn this passion into a career. I am excited to see where my journey shall take me :DD

                    <p>
                        Currently, I have just graduated high school and am working as a barista at Gong Cha part time (drop by,I can give you a discount!). I am 
                        also spending my time building projects (such as this website) and coding. It has been rough trying to be productive during the quarantine, 
                        but it has been rewarding thus far. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Asides from my small spurts of productivity, I have been spending a lot of my days jumping from one hobby to another. I love to exercise, and
                        have been swimming and working out as much as possible. In addition, I have been going on photography trips to take absolute bangers, and the places 
                        I have gone and the sights I have seen this summer have provided me with a new appreciation for the outdoors. You can check out my photography 
                        in the photography part of the website! I also love music, and have been hanging out a lot with my guitar and uke (hit me up for a jam sesh!)
                        whenever I have the chance. Finally, I have been hanging out with friends virutally and sometimes in person (following all physical distancing protocols!),
                        and I am glad to say that I have re-discovered the power of biking, which I had forgotten from my elementary school play-with-friends-at-the-park-afterschool-since-there-was-nothing-to-worry-about 
                        days. All in all, quarantine has given me a lot of time to be around myself, and as a result I feel like it has been somewhat of a blessing. However it is mostly 
                        a curse, and I yearn for the day I return to KBBQ. 
                    </p>

                        Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED talk, and if you would like to meet up, potentially at a KBBQ in the future, feel free to connect with me! My 
                        socials are below. I love meeting new people so please do not hesitate :)
